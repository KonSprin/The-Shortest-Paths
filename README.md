# The Shortest Paths

This is source code for my engineer degree diploma. 


## Roadmap
 1. Generating graphs that would represent real data
 2. Getting working the shortest path algorithm
 3. Visualizing graphs along with every path 
 4. Create ML that would find those paths

## TODO
 1. start with above nr 1.
